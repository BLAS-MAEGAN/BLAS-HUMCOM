    <u>"Over And Over"</u> &nbsp;is a girlxgirl story published in Wattpad and is currently my favorite book. It is a fan fiction made by the <font color='red'><i><b>great</font></i></b> author behind the name <u>Kim-Chichu</u>.<br><br>
    The story is about <u>Lisa</u>, a foreign exchange student from Thailand, finds her world, everything she knows and believes tested to their limits, 
    along with her sanity when one day she enters a hidden room on her campus and walks into an American high school in 1964. 
    and met an <font color='red'><i><b>undeaniably gorgeous</b></i></font> korean girl called <u>Jennie Kim</u>, who makes her life even more difficult and thrilling.<br><br>
    The book is a mixed type of mystery and fantasy as it contains time travelling, unravelling of secrets and unsolved cases way back in 1964. I can say that this book is by farthest, 
    the <font color='red'><i><b>best</font></i></b> fan fiction I've ever read. It is a <font color='red'><i><b>masterpiece</font></i></b> which is, enough to put me into a roller coaster ride and had me feeling mixed emotions because of how the story detailed the story was, and stably written.
